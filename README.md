# SolidMakerConverter
C# Project to Convert Cura Slicer files into Solidmaker/XVico X9 *.slm files.

You will need to use the Cura profile, The updated thumbnail create pytrhon script and the "filament profile" to generate a valid *.gcode file which the converter accepts.
The GCode file can then be dragged and dropped onto the SolidmakerConverter exe file and a *.slm file with the input files name will be created in the input files directory.

Use at your own risk... ;)
